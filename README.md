# Todo List example application

The Todo List application is the hello world application for the [Eventuate&trade; Platform](http://eventuate.io).
It illustrates how you can use the platform to write an application that uses Event Sourcing and Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS).
The Todo List application lets users maintain a todo list.

The Todo List application is a Java and Spring Boot application built using Eventuate&trade;'s Event Sourcing based programming model.
Todos are implemented by an Event Sourcing-based `TodoAggregate`.
The aggregate's events are persisted in the Eventuate event store.
The application also maintains a materialized view of the data in MySQL.

Don't forget to take a look at the other [Eventuate example applications](http://eventuate.io/exampleapps.html).

# Architecture

The following diagram shows the Todo List application architecture:

<img class="img-responsive" src="http://eventuate.io/demos/eventuate-todo-architecture.png">

The application consists of the following:

* Todo List Server - a Java and Spring Boot-based server-side application that has a HATEOAS-style REST API for creating, updating and querying todo list items.
* MySQL database - stores a materialized/denormalized view of todo list items.

Note: for simplicity, the Todo List service is deployed as a monolithic server but as you will see below, it consists of several independent modules.

# Todo List Server design

The Todo List server has a Spring MVC-based REST API for creating, updating and querying todo list items.
The Todo List server is written using the [Eventuate Client Framework for Java](http://eventuate.io/docs/java/eventuate-client-framework-for-java.html), which provides an [event sourcing based programming model](http://eventuate.io/whyeventsourcing.html).
The server persists todo list items as events in the [Eventuate event store](http://eventuate.io/howeventuateworks.html).
The Todo List server also maintains a materialized view of the todo list in MySQL.

The following diagram shows the design of the server:

<img class="img-responsive" src="http://eventuate.io/demos/eventuate-todo-server.png">

The application is structured using the [Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern](http://microservices.io/patterns/data/cqrs.html).
It consists of the following modules:

*  Command-side module - it handles requests to create and update (e.g. HTTP POST, PUT and DELETE requests) todo list items.
The business logic consists of event sourcing based `Todo` aggregates.

* Query-side module - it handles query requests (ie. HTTP GET requests) by querying a MySQL materialized view that it maintains.
It has an event handler that subscribes to Todo events and updates MySQL.

# Two versions of the source code

There are two versions of the source code:

* `single-module` - a single module Gradle project. It is the easiest to get started with.
* `multi-module` - a multi-module Gradle project.
It illustrates how to use multiple modules to separate the command side code from the query-side code.


# Building and running the application

This is a Gradle project.
However, you do not need to install Gradle since it will be downloaded automatically.
You just need to have Java 8 installed.

The details of how to build and run the services depend slightly on whether you are using Eventuate SaaS or Eventuate Local.

## Building and running using Eventuate SaaS

First, must [sign up to get your credentials](https://signup.eventuate.io/) in order to get free access to the SaaS version.

Next, build the application

```
./gradlew assemble
```

Next, you can launch the services using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/):

```
docker-compose up -d
```

## Building and running using Eventuate Local

First, build the application

```
./gradlew assemble -P eventuateDriver=local
```

Next, launch the services using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/):

```
export DOCKER_HOST_IP=...
docker-compose -f docker-compose-eventuate-local.yml up -d
```

Note: You need to set `DOCKER_HOST_IP` before running Docker Compose.
This must be an IP address or resolvable hostname.
It cannot be `localhost`.
See this [guide to setting `DOCKER_HOST_IP`](http://eventuate.io/docs/usingdocker.html) for more information.

# Using the application

Once the application has started, you can use the application via the Swagger UI.

If you are running the `multi-module` version:

* `http://${DOCKER_HOST_IP}:8081/swagger-ui.html` - the command-side service
* `http://${DOCKER_HOST_IP}:8082/swagger-ui.html` - the query-side service

If you are running the `single-module` version:

* `http://${DOCKER_HOST_IP}:8080/swagger-ui.html` - the monolithic application
